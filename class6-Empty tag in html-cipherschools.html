    Look you who came walking you who are alive you who have strayed
    <br>
     all the way cut here see the houses,the painting so many layers.
     <br>
     you who come so near see old beards, 
     <br>
     <br>
     the borders of houses and rotten handles on something that once had a name, 
     <br>
     something mineral an opening in a deer that swings on the outskirts of the heart

     'That is how they were built'was

           that meet in the middle

    a handstake, And that is <code>how we will knew while we cross those</code> bridges.</p>
